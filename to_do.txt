variables:    a) stepup voltage:4.2
              b) PWM frequency:25
              c) min PWM value:50
              d) max PWM value:90
              e) ratio of vector to xy position of line contour:0.4/0.6
              f) selection of frame crop:55
              h) position of Y servo:90

-diffferentiate objects:
       only check lowermost contour



-use AI tool to identify the object
       run program for however long, while it collects pictures of objects
       when program finishes, go into folder where images are saved, iterate through them and classify them and create database and new folder
       with the same pictures but now classified

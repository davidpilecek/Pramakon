TODO:

check if path for saving pics in main row 60 is correct

improve photo taking part of code to decrease blur
reason why blur despite sleep: after it sleeps, it's still at the same frame


in main, get rid of sleep functions and make it so that
robot is able to stop, aim at object, and aim back at track, then resume drive without
again interacting with object, 
ideas to achieve this: create variable X that is 1 when a green object is in frame,
only reactivate variable that says whether you want to take a picture after X=0 
variable X = obj is in frame
variable Y = want to take a pic of it

proposed succcession:
green object enters frame, X = 1, Y = 1
green object enters line of photo, 
if X = 1 and Y = 1, robot does:  stops
                                 robot aims at object
                                 takes photo, Y = 0
                                 robot resets to default servo position
robot drives on
object disappears from frame completely, X=0, Y = 1

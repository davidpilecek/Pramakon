-tweak settings and create optimal conditions for keeping robot on the center of the path

       variables:
              a) stepup voltage:4.2
              b) PWM frequency:25
              c) min PWM value:50
              d) max PWM value:90
              e) ratio of vector to xy position of line contour:0.45/0.55
              f) selection of frame crop:55
              h) position of Y servo:90

-find object of specific color on the ground and take picture of it
       -detect and highlight it
	if it's in a position that's within a radius of object that's already shot, ignore it	
        once it reaches a point in the image frame, 
	check whether it's already been taken a pic of, if so ignore it, else
        turn the camera to it and take pic of it
        move camera away from object, back onto original track, and drive along

-use AI tool to identify the object
       run program for however long, while it collects pictures of objects
       when program finishes, go into folder where images are saved, iterate through them and classify them and create database and new folder
       with the same pictures but now classified

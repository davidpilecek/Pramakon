1)keep camera at path

2)find object of specific color on the ground and take picture of it

3)use AI tool to identify the object


1) either: shift camera at path with a delay, so that it makes turning decisions first and only then does the camera turn
       or: from algorithm that determines how much to turn, make a new algorithm that shifts the camera


2.1)detect and highlight it
2.2)register once it appears, once center of obj contour is in middle of Y of image, aim camera at it
2.3)take pic of it
2.4)move away from object, back onto original track, and drive along

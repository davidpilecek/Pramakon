1)find object of specific color and take picture of it
2)improve contour seeking with camera
3)use AI tool to identify the object

find object of specific color, get as close to it as possible and take picture of it, then aim back on the track and drive along
do NOT get off the track, once you have to turn the camera 90 degrees to the left or right, that means it's as close
as possible and therefore you can take a pic of it.

once the turn is so sharp it has to utilize only one wheel, tilt camera to that direction for a while, then return back

1)keep camera at path


2)find object of specific color and take picture of it
3)use AI tool to identify the object



if no contour, turn cam 10 deg at direction where it was last headed



1) either: shift camera at path with a delay, so that it makes turning decisions first and only then does the camera turn
       or: from algorithm that determines how much to turn, make a new algorithm that shifts the camera


2.1)detect and highlight it
2.2)register once it appears - once bounding rectangle is larger than a fraction of the image, eg. 2/3, aim camera at it and shoot picture
2.3)move away from object, back onto original track, and drive along



find object of specific color, get as close to it as possible and take picture of it, then aim back on the track and drive along
do NOT get off the track, once you have to turn the camera 90 degrees to the left or right, that means it's as close
as possible and therefore you can take a pic of it.

once the turn is so sharp it has to utilize only one wheel, tilt camera to that direction for a while, then return back
